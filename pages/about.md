# About the programme

[**Data for Good at Meta**](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/) has partnered with the [**Open Knowledge Foundation**](https://okfn.org/) to design, develop, and deliver a training focused on how governments and nonprofits around the world can utilise free and open geospatial data and geospatial software. 

The Open Geodata Training Programme aims to:
- Raise awareness about free and open GIS and geospatial resources available to governments and nonprofits;
- Teach participants the skills needed to use these resources for public health and disaster response;
- Familiarise participants with Meta’s High Resolution Settlement Layer; and
- Create space for participants to produce innovative projects relevant to their work with the help of free and open data and software.

The training programme utilises a **unique two-phase format** which includes a [**live training phase**](live-training-phase/live-training.html) followed by a [**mentoring phase**](mentoring-phase/mentoring.html).

The [**live training phase**](live-training-phase/live-training.html) teaches participants how to think and solve problems geospatially using QGIS—a free and open source GIS—and other free and open geospatial resources. 

The [**mentoring phase**](mentoring-phase/mentoring.html) provides the participants the opportunity to learn specific skills, apply the things that they learned during the live training, and utilise these new skills and knowledge to complete a mapping or QGIS-related project that they can use in their day-to-day work. 

This format addresses two challenges common to training programmes: 
- Attending a training does not translate easily into actionable skills: participants often leave frustrated because the time constraints of traditional trainings leave them unable to digest what they have learned
- Remote trainings make it more difficult to support participants who are lagging behind: the mentoring can be a place for participants to get additional explanations on topics they had trouble to follow
