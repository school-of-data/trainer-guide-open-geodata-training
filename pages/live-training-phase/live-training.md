# About the live training

The live training phase introduces and teaches participants how to think and solve problems geospatially using QGIS—a free and open source GIS—and other free and open geospatial resources such as the HRSL. It usually consists of 2 days of remote training divided into four 3-hour sessions.

## Objectives

The objectives of the live training are:
- To introduce participants to free and open GIS and geospatial resources available to them such as QGIS, OSM, and the High Resolution settlement Layer (HRSL) by the Data for Good team at Meta.
- To teach participants the skills needed to utilize these free and open resources.
- To help the participants identify possible projects relevant to their work that they can do during the mentoring phase.
