# During the training

## Training activities

```yaml remark
type: success
text: There are several activities that can be used during the training. Those given below are some examples that can be mixed-and-matched.
```
### Lectures
- the trainer presents a topic and provides examples

### Breakout/hands-on guided exercises
- an opportunity for the participants to apply what was presented in the lecture by doing hands-on exercises together with the trainer
- one or several participants are asked to share their screen and perform exercises
- the participants can be divided into 2 groups if necessary

### Off-camera exercises/assignments
- short exercises that will be done by the participants without the guidance of the trainer
- given to support and augment the learning experience
- outputs are discussed upon resumption of the training

### Question/answer session
- open forum for participants to ask questions and clarifications about the topic or exercises


## Recording the training
- The live training sessions should be recorded.
- The two (2) trainers should record the training simultaneously.
    - To do this, the two trainers should both be hosts of the meeting.
- The recording may be stored on the cloud (using the provided Zoom account) or on the trainerâ€™s local computer. In the case of the latter, the trainer should share a copy of the recording after.

## Curated questions
- Curate a list of questions asked during the training (and answers to these questions). The Slack channel, a shared Google doc, or the Zoom messenger may be used for this.
- Share the curated questions and answers after the training.

## Brainstorm projects for the mentoring phase
```yaml remark
type: success
text: Before the end of the live training sessions, the participants should have an idea of what projects they would like to do during the mentoring phase.
```
- Ideally, these projects should be done by group and should utilize the things they learned during the training.
- Additionally, having projects that are directly related to their day-to-day work is advised.
- Utilize the [Mentoring phase project document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dl2sKPVg0dQ3ymgYLuQwFUEo3nkhLPhTheeFE2OJ9IM/edit?usp=sharing) to help participants with brainstorming their project.

## Post-training survey (live-training)
```yaml remark
type: success
text: Ask the participants to complete the post-training survey for the live training prior to leaving the video-conference at the end of the live training phase.
```

```yaml remark
type: warning
text: The post-training survey should be localized/translated to the language of the training.
```
