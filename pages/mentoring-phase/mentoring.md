# About the mentoring

```yaml remark
type: success
text: The mentoring phase provides the participants the opportunity to learn specific skills, apply the things that they learned during the live training, and utilise these new skills and knowledge to complete a mapping or QGIS-related project that they can use in their day-to-day work.
```

## Time commitment and expectations

### From participants
- During the mentoring phase, each participant is encouraged and expected to commit one day (8 hours) per week to work on the project. 
- For a group consisting of 4 members, that is equal to around 4 man-days per week for the project.

    - [Mentoring calls](/pages/mentoring-phase/activities.html#weekly-mentoring-calls) with groups/participants to track progress of their projects.
    - [Advanced mentoring sessions](/pages/mentoring-phase/activities.html#advanced-mentoring-sessions-[optional]).
    - Answering emails/questions, preparing materials, and other [mentoring activities](/pages/mentoring-phase/activities.html).
