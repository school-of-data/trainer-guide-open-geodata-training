# Pre-event surveys

```yaml remark
type: success
text: The pre-event surveys are designed to get the background information of the participants, their expectations of the training, and an overview of their skills as to data literacy/GIS in general and QGIS + OSM in particular.
```

```yaml remark
type: warning
text: Conduct of the pre-event surveys may be skipped if the information about the participants are made available at the start of training preparation.

Knowing the background and skill levels of the participants is important to allow us:

- To divide the participants into different groups if needed.
    - For example some participants might have no experience working with structured, geographical data, or QGIS while some participants have more extensive experience working with QGIS, OSM, etc. In such a case, it might be good to divide the participants into two groups—a beginner group and an intermediate/advanced group and have the groups do different tasks during the breakout/off-cam sessions so that the training isn’t too fast for the beginners but also not too boring for the intermediate/advanced users.
- To create a training agenda that is tailored to the needs and skills of the participants.

## Background survey

```yaml remark
type: success
text: The background survey is used to get background information about the participants such as their names, contact details, organizations and roles, self-assessment of their data literacy and geospatial skills, how they think the training can help them, information about their video-conferencing tools, and their experience working with data and GIS.
```

```yaml remark
type: warning
text: The background survey should be localized/translated to the language of the training.
```
