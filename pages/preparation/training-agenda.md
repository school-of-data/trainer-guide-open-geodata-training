# Training agenda

```yaml remark
type: success
text: The training agenda includes the schedule of activities during the two-day live training sessions and should be tailor-fit to the needs and expectations of the participants. This is done by utilizing previously provided information about the participants or the results of the pre-event surveys when designing the agenda.
```

```yaml remark
type: warning
text: The field of geospatial is very broad and it is impossible to cover everything during the two-day training. As such, it is important to have the training agenda tailored to the needs and skills of the participants.
```

## General considerations

```yaml remark
type: warning
text: The training curriculum is designed mostly for an introductory training. While it is possible to hold an advanced training, this would require resources and materials that are not readily available from the curriulum which would require additional time and effort to prepare.

```
- Include **breakout, off-cam, or show-and-tell sessions** in the agenda so that it doesn’t become simply a lecture. Try to **make the agenda as interactive as possible**.
- Reserve time at the start of the first day for opening remarks by a coordinator/representative from Meta. Make sure to inform and invite the coordinator beforehand.
- Identify the following information about the participants:
    - Is there a significant difference in the skill level of the participants such that hey be divided into groups based on skill level? 
        - *Can you have one group for complete beginners and another for experienced users?*
    - Is there a common interest among the participants that can be used as the theme of the training?
        - *Do a majority of participants want to learn how to create maps and visualizations using QGIS?*
        - *Do a majority of participants want to learn a specific analysis/process in QGIS?*
        - *Do all participants work in the same field—e.g. health, disaster risk reduction, agriculture, etc.?*

## Data pipeline agenda

```yaml remark
type: success
text: This agenda is designed around the <a href="https://schoolofdata.org/methodology/">Data Pipeline approach of the School of Data</a>. It introdudces both conceptual and practical applications of geospatial information and how to work with geospatial data using QGIS.
```
- Conceptual information such as basic geographic concepts used in Geographic Information Systems, Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) applications, OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) will be introduced.
- Participants will also learn about the Data Pipeline approach to working with data as applied to geospatial data and QGIS. This includes:
    - Defining the geospatial problem/question
    - Finding data and getting them into QGIS
        - *loading layers and connecting to services*
        - *georeferencing and digitizing in QGIS*
    - Verifying and cleaning data
    - Processing and analyzing data
        - *working with attributes*
        - *working with rasters and vectors*
    - Presenting data through maps and visualizations

## General agenda

```yaml remark
type: success
text: A general agenda goes over the training curriculum modules in order.
```
- Introduces the general functions, features, and capabilities of QGIS and/or the HRSL to the participants.
- Introductory course.
- Useful if all or a majority of the participants are beginners or have no specific preference when it comes to the topics they want to learn.
- Day 1 example:
    - Basic geographic concepts used in Geographic Information Systems
    - Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) applications
    - OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL)
    - An introduction to QGIS
    - How to load and save layers in QGIS
    - How to style layers in QGIS
    - How to make printable maps in QGIS
    - How to work with the attribute table
- Day 2 example:
    - Georeferencing and digitizing in QGIS
    - Vector processing and analysis
    - Raster processing and analysis
    - Brainstorming for mentoring projects

## Thematic agenda

```yaml remark
type: success
text: A thematic agenda focuses on specific topics or specific use-cases of QGIS. It might prove useful for trainings with experienced participants looking to upskill themselves or for participants with very specific needs. A thematic agenda around specific use-cases can utilize the Data pipeline approach.
```

```yaml remark
type: warning
text: A thematic agenda will require additional preparation and resources outside of the training curriculum.
