- Trainers should familiarize themselves with how the Zoom platform worksâ€”how to record the meeting, how to share screens, how to create breakout rooms, polls, etc.
- The trainers should also test that their audio and video are working fine.
- Participants may be invited to the dry run in order to test their audio, video, etc.
- You can also use the dry run and technical test meeting to help participants troubleshoot their machines if they are having trouble installing and running QGIS, downloading the data, etc.
