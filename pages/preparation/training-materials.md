- It is highly recommended to utilize already existing materials outside of the training curriculum to use as a resource or supplement during the live training. 
    - This could include the QGIS documentation, blog posts and articles, and YouTube videos showing basic to advanced QGIS functionalities. 
    - This is especially useful when the external resource is in the local language of the training.
    - This is particularly necessary for thematic and advanced trainings.

## Training curriculum
```yaml remark
type: success
text: The training curriculum serves as an open reference that participants can utilize even beyond the training.
```
- [Curriculum website](https://school-of-data.github.io/GIS-curriculum/)
- The training curriculum is designed mostly for an introductory training to QGIS.
- The lessons, modules, and activities in the training curriculum would suffice for most training events.
- It is localized for 17 countries and available in 7 languages.
    - Localizations for other countries and languages would require additional time and effort.
