```

## Data visualization / mapping project
### By end of Week 1
- The data needed for the project have been collected.
- The trainer provides the participants with options and resources to determine what data visualization or mapping technique works best with the project they are doing.

### By end of Week 2
- The group sends the first draft of the data visualization/map
- The trainer provides possible improvements to the data visualization/map

### By end of Week 3
- The group sends the second draft of the data visualization
- The group and trainer test the draft visualizations/maps by showing it to possible users/audience and getting feedback.

### By end of Week 4
- The group and trainer finalize the data visualization based on the feedback from the user test.
- The short report about the project is finished.

## Geospatial analysis project
### By end of Week 1
- The data needed for the project have been collected.
- The trainer provides the group with options and resources to determine the next steps for doing the geospatial analysis such as how to pre-process the data and what processing steps to use.

### By end of Week 2
- The group have prepared the data for processing.

### By end of Week 3
- The group have performed initial processing and have preliminary results.
- Trainer provides feedback and suggestions to refine the results or how to display the results as a visualization/map.

### By end of Week 4
- The geospatial analysis and visualization/maps are finalized.
- The short report about the project is finished.

## Modelling / programming project
### By end of Week 1
- Data needed for the project have been collected.
- The process that will be modelled/automated/programmed has been identified.
- The trainer provides the group with resources about the different processing algorithms that can be used, the QGIS Graphical Modeller, or Python scripting in QGIS.

### By end of Week 2
- The group can perform the process manually in QGIS.
- The group sends a step-by-step guide or flowchart of how the process is done in QGIS.
- The trainer shows how a model is made or how a script is written in QGIS.

### By end of Week 3
- The participants have converted the manual process into a QGIS model or Python script.
- The model or script is tested and refined.

### By end of Week 4
- The model or script is finalized.
- The short report about the project is finished.
