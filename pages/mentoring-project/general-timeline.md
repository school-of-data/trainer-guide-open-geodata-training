## What to do if a project does not seem feasible
- If the project does not seem feasible, the participants may choose to change topic or create a report highlighting what they learned during the process of doing the project.
- The focus of the mentoring phase isn’t for the participants to simply finish a project but to learn and experience what it entails to create data-driven geospatial projects that utilize the things they learned during the training. With this in mind, sometimes it is better for participants to write about their experience doing the project and share what they learned than finishing a project that is too simple or one that does not add value to them or their organizations.
