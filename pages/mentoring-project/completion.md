# Project completion
```yaml remark
type: success
text: Sometimes, 4 weeks isn't enough to finish the project and that's okay.
```

- In case some of the participants were unable to complete their projects and there is time allocated for the mentoring phase, this remaining time can be used to help the participants complete the projects even beyond the 4-week mentoring phase.
- Projects can be considered as:
    - **Complete** - the objectives of the project have been met and outputs are available
    - **Partially/Provisionally complete** - the project is more than halfway completed and needs a bit of work for the outputs to be fully useful, presentable, and achieve the project objectives
    - **Incomplete** - the project is still in its infancy and cannot be completed without a lot of work
- In lieu of the projects, participants can also write a report about their learning experience. This report, if it includes all the necessary information, can be considered a substitute for a completed project.
